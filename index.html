Since completing the course, I've successfully switched carees, working as a Softwaare Engineer at a VR startup."

I was encoraged to enroll by former student of their who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hand-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in paricular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In face, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
